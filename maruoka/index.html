                  <strong> <!--c-->In the east indie<!--b-->s, there is a beautiful group of lilypads. Once upon a time they used to be stars, dancing every night a<!--f-->cross<!-- --> the water's surface along with the mo<!--e-->on and the other stars. <!--a-->For the longest time they danced their dance and they were happy. One morning however, when the moon goddess called all the stars to return back to heaven, some of them didn't listen and continued to dance. That's when the witch found them and cursed them to be lilypads out of jealousy for their beauty and grace. <!--d-->Now the lilypads are forced to lay still in the water until the full moon rises, that's when the witch comes by the lake again and starts to sing. Only then can the lilypads dance again until the morning after comes. </strong> - <i>Belgian Fairy Tale</i>
